## Description
***

This is a social network single page web application that I built mainly to advance my knowledge and understanding of creating an application that incorporates a frontend and a backend.

iaNtheLoop encompasses many of the features of a traditional social network application. After a user has created an account and logged in, they will be able to take advantage of the features that this application provides **including:**

 ‚úÖ Follow/Following system </br>
 ‚úÖ Profiles</br>
 ‚úÖ Profile Walls</br>
 - Posts (text, picture, video)
 - Comments
 - Reply comments
 - Likes

 ‚úÖ Newsfeed </br>
 ‚úÖ Follow Suggestions </br>
 ‚úÖ Customizable User Settings</br>
 - Delete Account
 - Change Password
 - Block certain users from seeing (profile, stories, messages)

 ‚úÖ User Search </br>
 ‚úÖ Notifications </br>
 ‚úÖ Realtime Messaging </br>
 ‚úÖ Stories </br>
 ‚úÖ Reviews</br>


 The technologies that are currently used in this application are [**Laravel**](https://laravel.com/)  for the API and the JWT authentication mechanism, [**Vue JS**](https://vuejs.org/) (couples nicely with Laravel) and [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/) for the frontend , and [**mySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) as the database. [**Vuex**](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) is being used to manage state on the front end because there was too much shared state that was needed in different parts of the application.

 So far the most challenging thing to implement was the **Follow/Follower** system. I initially over complicated things by not making a dedicated table to hold **following/followers**, instead stuffing them in a JSON column. While this worked, it did make for more work and complicated logic to keep everything in sync. Eventually I would like to refactor it because it will eventually introduce scaling problems.
